# fizzbuzz
A small program to which returns fizz if the user enters a multiple of 3, buzz if they enter a multiple of 5 and fizzbuzz if they enter a multiple of both.  Any other number is returned to the screen.

This program was developed during a Pair Programming session with myself and James Holton and was intended to introduce us to Pair Programming and TDD using RSpec.
